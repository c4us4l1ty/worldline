# PRD Deltas — deviations from the Product Requirements Document

Locked decisions from the planning session are marked [approved].

## Architecture

1. **UI framework: Dioxus** [approved] — PRD offered "Leptos or Dioxus";
   Dioxus chosen for dx hot-reload + Tauri IPC fit.
2. **Multi-device key model: single root key** [approved] — all devices
   derive identical keys from the mnemonic; "pairing" = re-entering the 12
   words. No per-device keys in v1.
3. **X25519 dropped from the E2EE path** — the PRD lists "X25519/ChaCha20"
   but payload encryption with a single root key needs only symmetric
   ChaCha20-Poly1305 (HKDF-derived). X25519 becomes relevant only with
   per-device keys (v2); the protocol can adopt it without breaking changes.
4. **Session tokens** — PRD says "PASETO / JWT". v0.1 uses opaque random
   bearer ids with server-side session state (equivalent security for a
   single-cluster relay; revocable). PASETO v4.local wrapping can be added
   behind the same `Authorization: Bearer` header without protocol change.
5. **AI model names not hardcoded** — PRD names GPT-4o / Claude 3.5 Sonnet /
   Haiku / Gemini Flash. Tier-1/Tier-2 model ids are user-configurable BYOK
   settings (`app_settings.tier1_model`, `tier2_model`), provider adapters:
   OpenAI-compatible + Anthropic [approved].
6. **Manual goal-creation fallback** [approved] — without an API key (or
   offline), users hand-author goals/milestones/directives locally; the AI
   restructures plans once a key exists.
7. **Relay in monorepo, sqlx dual-backend** [approved] — SQLite for dev/tests
   (zero infrastructure), Postgres for production. The relay stores only
   opaque blobs either way, so the zero-knowledge contract holds.
8. **Desktop-first; mobile-ready** [approved] — no Android/iOS scaffolding in
   v1 (sandbox lacks toolchains); wl-core is platform-clean so
   `tauri android/ios init` is drop-in later.
9. **Fonts bundled as TTF** (not woff2/CDN) — webview-compatible,
   local-first; conversion tooling was unavailable in the build sandbox.

## Schema (PRD §7)

10. **`identity_config.created_at INTEGER` → `hlc_timestamp TEXT`** — PRD's
    own §7 header says "HLC Unix epoch" while every other table uses TEXT
    `pt.ctr.device`; standardized on TEXT everywhere ("HLC everywhere").
11. **Added tables the PRD describes in prose but omits from SQL**:
    - `goals` (root of milestone tree; velocity anchor: Δ remaining
      milestones / Δ remaining days — PRD §5.4 formula),
    - `directive_phases` (progressive micro-directives, PRD §5.2),
    - `check_ins` (evening audit, PRD §5.4),
    - `bailouts` (escape-hatch ledger with reason enum, PRD §5.3),
    - `app_settings` (non-secret config; BYOK keys stay in Stronghold),
    - `crdt_applied` (pull idempotence watermark),
    - `hlc_clock` / `sync_cursor` (clock + cursor persistence).
12. **`crdt_outbox` extended** with `created_at_epoch_ms` (queue ordering)
    and `pushed` flag (durable drain state).
13. **`directives.progressive_total` added** — PRD has `progressive_step`
    but no total; phases need both.
14. **`milestones` gained `goal_id`** — PRD's milestones had no parent.

## UX / behavior

15. **Bailout scope-downsizing: floor at 15 minutes** — PRD says "halve";
    unbounded halving of small tasks produces noise. 20 min → 15 (floor).
16. **Estimate recalibration floor 60%** — velocity-driven downsizing never
    shrinks future estimates below 60% of the original (avoid compounding
    under-estimation in the other direction).
17. **Default hotkey `Alt+Space`** as PRD states, configurable in Settings;
    noted collision with Linux window-manager menus (WM config expected to
    release the combo, or the user rebinds).
18. **Verification challenge indices** — 3-word verification now uses
    shell-issued random indices per onboarding (was deterministic in v0.1);
    the UI falls back to fixed positions only when the shell omits them.
19. **Vault key is a device-local `0600` file, not the OS keychain** —
    `crates/wl-app/src/vault.rs` stores the Stronghold snapshot key at
    `0600` in the app data dir. Same threat envelope as the SQLite DB
    itself; OS-keychain migration is tracked future work (the `Vault::open`
    boundary is already shaped for it). No secrets ever touch SQLite/DOM.
20. **Snapshot KDF work factor is 0** — iota-Stronghold's file encryption
    defaults to a multi-second password-KDF per commit; our snapshot key
    is a 32-byte CSPRNG secret (not a password), so stretching is pure
    latency. Upstream documents 0 as correct for strong keys.
21. **tauri-plugin-stronghold NOT registered as a plugin** — its JS-side
    commands would expose a second, zero-keyed vault to the webview. The
    shell manages its own `Vault` instance; the crate stays as a dependency
    for the snapshot format + `Stronghold` type.

## Toolchain

19. **Desktop shell excluded from workspace** — `crates/wl-app` needs
    webkit2gtk dev headers; CI-less sandbox builds stay green without them.
    `scripts/setup-linux.sh` installs prerequisites; the shell compiles on
    any normal Linux dev machine.
20. **In-process transport for convergence tests** — US-4's "<300 ms" is
    asserted on the merge path (excluding real network RTT) in
    `wl-sync/tests/convergence.rs`.
